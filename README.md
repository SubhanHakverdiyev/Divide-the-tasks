Android app using KOTLIN for dividing tasks between rommates.


## Problem Definition
Problem is about dividing tasks(houseworks) between me and my rommates. Each time either they chose the easy tasks and harder one left for me. Then I decided to write this simple app for dividing tasks between me and my roomate. 


## Solution Design
Solution is very simple. We are entering 2 task group which we chose beforehand(fairly). Then the app decides randomly which task group is for person.
